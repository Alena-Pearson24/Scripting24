<h3>Personality and Habits</h3>
<p>
    The Joker is described as a manic clown, psychopath but people also think that he has an antisocial personality disorder with an uneasy smile.
    This disorder causes him to smile and laugh uncontrollably in certain situations.
    He always finds a way to get what he wants by usually threatening them. The Joker is a scary, uneasy, sneaky man.
